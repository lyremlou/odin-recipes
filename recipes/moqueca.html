        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, add coconut oil and a drizzle of olive oil. On medium heat, saute chopped onion, bell peppers and jalapeno until lightly soft, about 5-8 minutes. Then add chopped garlic, paprika and cayenne and stir to combine, for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes with their juice and stir everything together, cooking for another 1-2 minutes so the tomato juice can evaporate a bit.</li>
            <li>Pat dry the fish very well with a pepper towel and season with salt and pepper on both sides. Lay the fish down on top of the vegetables and pour the vegetable stock and coconut milk. Add lime zest and season with salt and pepper,</li>
            <li>Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes on medium-low heat or until the fish is fully cooked.</li>
            <li>While stew is cooking, make the rice: In a small pot, saute chopped onion and garlic in olive oil until lightly caramelized. Then add jasmine rice and stir to coat so onion and olive oil are evenly distributed through the rice.</li>
            <li>Add vegetable stock and season with salt and pepper. Bring rice to a boil, then lower heat to a simmer and continue cooking for about 20 minutes until the liquid has evaporated.</li>
